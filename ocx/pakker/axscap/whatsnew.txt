AXSoft CaptureScreen 1.2 (07/16/2000)
-------------------------------------
When saving a captured image using the
SaveCapture() method, sometimes it did
not save to a file when capturing a region
of the screen using the CaptureRegion()
method. Problem has been fixed.


AXSoft CaptureScreen 1.1 (07/06/2000)
-------------------------------------
1) Using CaptureRegion to capture a large
   portion of the screen sometimes caused
   an OverFlow error. The same overflow error
   occured with other functions if certain
   properties of the window were too large.
2) Cleaned up code for improved performance
