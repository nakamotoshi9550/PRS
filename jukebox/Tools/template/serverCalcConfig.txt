<NAME>CalcField1
<DESC>
The calculated field feature for database queries allows for sorting, search, filtering, distinct selection and accumulation also for a calculated value.
Performance will take a hit when sorting on calculated values, retrieving distinct values or accumulating large queries since the whole result set must be traversed. 
To disable sorting on a browse column use the setNoColumnSort method. 
To remove a calculated column from the dynamic filter use the filterExcludeFields attribute.


<CODE> 
/* 
   Created: <cre.date> by <cre.user>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
PROCEDURE custAddress:
  DEF INPUT PARAM  irBuffer      AS ROWID NO-UNDO.
  DEF INPUT PARAM  icSessionId   AS CHAR NO-UNDO.
  DEF OUTPUT PARAM ocReturn      AS CHAR NO-UNDO.

  FIND Customer WHERE ROWID(Customer) = irBuffer NO-LOCK NO-ERROR.

  ocReturn = Customer.Address.
END PROCEDURE.
